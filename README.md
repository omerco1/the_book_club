# The book club

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The book club is a web application written in flask, html, bootstrap and javascript that utilizes postgressql to create a website for book reviewing! Users are able to leave a review for any book that exists on our database. This project was meant as a learning experience to interact with thirdparty API's (from GoodReads, active SQL databases as well as building my own API backend.
